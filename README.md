# UEFN Project: JW
This repository showcases all the code written for the JW project, completely refactored and rewritten from the ground up to be as performant as possible for large multiplayer sessions. The project utilizes async/concurrency throughout as a means to squeeze as much performance out of the Verse VM as possible whilst keeping code as simple as possible.

Although this codebase and it's associated project is now abandoned/archived, many of the core features and methodologies that I developed for JW have been refined over time and continue to be utilized in current/future projects.
